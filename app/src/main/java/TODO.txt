Server:
Checks for userId fails

lib\collections\questions\.js ln 6:
check(this.userId, String);

lib\collections\votes.js ln 14
check(Meteor.userId(), String);


App:
Authentication, userId on server does not get set.
Votes: Need to store bool about users vote on every question, to be able to call unvote. ( for local user ) currently only insertVote is called every time.
